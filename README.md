This repository consists of multiple projects that involve HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. One of the projects is an adopt-a-dog/cat website, and there are also smaller testing exercises that helped me to gain a deeper understanding of these programming languages. Each project emphasizes the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces, functional features, and maintaining clean and organized code.
